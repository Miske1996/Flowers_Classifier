# Flower Classifier

In this project, I have trained a model to classify 120 flower species using Oxford 102 Flowers dataset using Fastai and pytorch.The architecture chosen for this project is resnet34 , and i got an accuracy of 96,67%.
The flowers chosen to be flower commonly occuring in the United Kingdom. Each class consists of between 40 and 258 images. The details of the categories and the number of images for each class can be found on this category statistics page: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/categories.html


# Testing the model

I created a script to predict the categorie of 1626 flowers downloaded from the internet .
